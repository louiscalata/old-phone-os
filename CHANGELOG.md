# Changelog

Notable changes to Old Phone OS Interface (OPOS), in Keep a Changelog style.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Over-the-air updates for the Surface Duo OS image ([design and as-built notes](docs/ota-update.md)): a root updater with its systemd units, installed by `packaging/duo-os/build-image.sh` (`OPOS_UPDATE_SIGNERS`, `OPOS_UPDATE_URL`); an opt-in update client and `/update` page in OPOS; `tools/opos-release.py` and `deploy/duo-push-update.ps1` to build, sign and push a release ([how-to](docs/ota-release-howto.md)). Implemented and tested on Linux with stand-ins for systemd, runuser and the browser; not tested on the phone.

### Changed

- `opos-kiosk` waits for the OPOS server before every start of the browser, so the browser comes back only after a restarted server answers.

- README now includes an illustrative older-phone vignette, new final-tree Muse Glimmer Ask and Why? captures in light and dark, with all eight measured UI response times, the quoted first dark Ask answer, and current pause status. All eight requests returned Glimmer replies within the 115-second deadline; the new Why? measurements replace the earlier rules-fallback observations for this source. Simulation wording distinguishes the profile drain runs from the worn-battery burst-shaping evaluation; postmarketOS wording separates the recorded QEMU boot from outstanding integration acceptance and untested physical-phone behavior.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Public snapshot (`bb9c846`): a prototype phone interface that keeps calls and messages on while pausing less essential work toward an owner's chosen time.
- A desktop demo with simulated battery, calls and messages, requiring Python 3.11 or newer; an optional local helper explains decisions and may add pauses.
- Follow-up (`857e235`): tests compare published simulation numbers with simulator results.
- Panel fixes (`bd0e465`): `pyproject.toml` and CI for Python 3.11 and 3.13.

### Changed

- Follow-up: renamed the displayed project name to Old Phone OS Interface; existing installer markers, service descriptions and package fields retain the old name.
- Panel fixes: clarified the simulated battery and modem in the postmarketOS kiosk, battery trade-offs and the meaning of a worn battery in the docs.

### Fixed

- Follow-up: handled incomplete helper replies, transport errors and deeply nested replies; limited claimed pauses to paused tasks and gave the last route the remaining time.
- Follow-up: made Wikipedia search ignore proxies and redirects.
- Follow-up: corrected demo-goal handling and wording, including empty batteries and goals set after their time.
- Follow-up: added one plain message for Python versions older than 3.11 on every platform.
- Panel fixes: used one final pause decision across screens, helper facts and simulated drain, with safety limits applied after owner actions.
- Panel fixes: shared the daily-goal budget across tasks in a fixed order and aligned simulated drain with the time-left estimate.
- Panel fixes: checked helper routes before sending Why and Ask questions, restricted the network route to private addresses and preserved route settings in installed services.
- Panel fixes: verified the optional AI-tools installer against a pinned SHA-256 digest and refused redirects to another host.
