# Changelog

Notable changes to Old Phone OS Interface (OPOS), in Keep a Changelog style.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- README now includes an illustrative older-phone vignette, real Muse Glimmer Ask captures with the quoted answer and elapsed times, and the observed Why? rules fallbacks. Simulation wording distinguishes the profile drain runs from the worn-battery burst-shaping evaluation; postmarketOS wording separates the recorded QEMU boot from outstanding integration acceptance and untested physical-phone behavior.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Public snapshot (`bb9c846`): a prototype phone interface that keeps calls and messages on while pausing less essential work toward an owner's chosen time.
- A desktop demo with simulated battery, calls and messages, requiring Python 3.11 or newer; an optional local helper explains decisions and may add pauses.
- Follow-up (`857e235`): tests compare published simulation numbers with simulator results.
- Panel fixes (`bd0e465`): `pyproject.toml` and CI for Python 3.11 and 3.13.

### Changed

- Follow-up: renamed the displayed project name to Old Phone OS Interface; existing installer markers, service descriptions and package fields retain the old name.
- Panel fixes: clarified the simulated battery and modem in the postmarketOS kiosk, battery trade-offs and the meaning of a worn battery in the docs.

### Fixed

- Follow-up: handled incomplete helper replies, transport errors and deeply nested replies; limited claimed pauses to paused tasks and gave the last route the remaining time.
- Follow-up: made Wikipedia search ignore proxies and redirects.
- Follow-up: corrected demo-goal handling and wording, including empty batteries and goals set after their time.
- Follow-up: added one plain message for Python versions older than 3.11 on every platform.
- Panel fixes: used one final pause decision across screens, helper facts and simulated drain, with safety limits applied after owner actions.
- Panel fixes: shared the daily-goal budget across tasks in a fixed order and aligned simulated drain with the time-left estimate.
- Panel fixes: checked helper routes before sending Why and Ask questions, restricted the network route to private addresses and preserved route settings in installed services.
- Panel fixes: verified the optional AI-tools installer against a pinned SHA-256 digest and refused redirects to another host.
